# :warning: Warning about this section :warning:

As a heads up, later sections here might not run based on the current version of the code, especially before the major refactors made in CH9. After refactors I didn't go back to fix previous chapters to work with the most up to date code base.

To find a working version of the code for a particular challenge, I suggest going in the version history back to the last modification made and using that as the source.
