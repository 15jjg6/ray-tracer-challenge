# The Ray Tracer Challenge

Implementation of the code from the book [The Ray Tracer Challenge: A Test-Driven Guide to Your First 3D Renderer](http://www.raytracerchallenge.com/).

## Usage

### Building and running end-of-chapter challenges:

* Edit the `MAIN_FILE_NAME` variable in `./CMakeLists.txt` to the name of the chapter file
* Run the command below:

```bash
 bash ./build.sh
```

## TODO:

- Import and use `gtest`
- Do some sample tests using gtest
- Fix the tests folder to actually be tests of your code
- Create a bash script that does all of your building for you
    - main function building
    - test building
