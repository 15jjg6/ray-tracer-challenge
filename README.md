# The Ray Tracer Challenge

Implementation of the code from the book [The Ray Tracer Challenge: A Test-Driven Guide to Your First 3D Renderer](http://www.raytracerchallenge.com/).

## TODO:

- Create a writeup of how to use cmake and make to build your app in the challenges
- Import and use `gtest`
- Fix the tests folder to actually be tests of your code
- Create a bash script that does all of your building for you
